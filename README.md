## Quick Dictionary

* ## Project Purpose
    Dictionaries are one of the best beneficial guides for our lives.Problem was that we actually do not know whether word is memorized or not.Thanks to <b>Quick Dictionary</b> , the words that are flowing on the screen , do not depend on anything indeed.User cannot know how words come in screen or flowing on it.The only thing known is that words are come out on the screen randomly.

* ## How it works ?

    There are so many graphical library compatible with C and C++ languages. In this project , I choosed **[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)** which supply an advanced control over the graphical and IO controlling issues which are effective for the user part of the program.

* ## SDL - Simple Direct Media Layer 

    Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

    SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are [bindings available](https://www.libsdl.org/languages.php) for several other languages, including C# and Python.
